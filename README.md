# 99names
Chrome Extension that shows a random name of Allah in Arabic and English on each new tab.

If you're interested in contributing, please 

Feature Requests:
- Simple reflection prompts tied to each name, to be shown in smaller font at the bottom of the screen (for example Al Wadood/The Most Loving/How do you experience God's love for you?
- Random background every time, rather than the same pink gradient
- Show a different name every day but the same name for the whole day, inviting people to reflect on a name for the whole day
